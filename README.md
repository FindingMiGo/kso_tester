Yesterday, I went to Yoshinoya in my neighborhood. Yoshinoya. There were so many people there that I couldn't sit down. And when I looked closer, I saw a banner hanging from the wall that said "150 yen discount". I thought, What a jerk. I thought it was stupid. You guys shouldn't come to Yoshinoya, which you don't usually come to, just for a 150 yen discount, you idiots. It's 150 yen, 150 yen. There were some parents and their children there. A family of four at Yoshinoya. Congratulations. I can't stand to see them saying, "Okay, Dad, I'm going to order the extra large!" I can't stand it anymore. You guys, I'll give you 150 yen and you can have that seat. Yoshinoya should be more bleak, you know. You could start a fight with the guy sitting across from you at the U-shaped table at any time. It's a stab-or-be-stabbed kind of atmosphere, isn't it? Women and children, stay out of it. Then, just when I thought I was finally able to sit down, the guy next to me asked for a "tsuyudaku". That's when I lost my temper again. You know, "tsuyudaku" is not popular these days. You idiot. What do you mean, "tsuyudaku" with a smug look on your face? I want to ask you if you really want to eat "tsuyudaku". I want to ask you. I want to ask you for an hour. I'm a Yoshinoya connoisseur, and I can tell you that the latest fad among Yoshinoya connoisseurs is Oomori negidaku gyoku. This is the way to order it. Negidaku means that there are more onions in it. But with less meat. That's it. And a big bowl of gyoku (egg) on top of that. This is the best. However, it is a double-edged sword, because if you order this, you will be marked by the waiter next time. It's not recommended for amateurs. Well, you amateurs should just eat the beef salmon set meal.

# How the f**k to use

- First, do not clone this sh*t in your ft_printf repository.
- Next, do not run `bash ft_printf_tester.sh`. Three files will not be created in out, and the diff will not be populated with the difference between your printf and the original.
- Then continue the review with YOUR OWN EYES AND HANDS.
